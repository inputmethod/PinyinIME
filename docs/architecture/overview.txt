UI -use-> Domain <-use- Data

UI: (View/Fragment/Activity/Service)

  - retrieve data from domain and display it.
  - know nothing about objects/classes in Data layer. (SRP, OCP)

Domain: (keyboard input method specifics)
  - action handler interface for UI.
  - data presenter interface for UI, input method structure, such as keyboard and key.
  - mediator between UI and Data layer, but NOT know the concrete object in Data layer. (DIP)
  - data controller interface to be implement by Data layer.

Data: (Db, File, System Service, Framework or 3rd party libraries)
  - implementation of domain interface to provide concrete data objects.
